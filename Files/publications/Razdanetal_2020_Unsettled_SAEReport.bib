  abstract    = {Autonomous technology has the potential to greatly benefit personal transportation,
 last-mile delivery, logistics, and many other mobility applications. In many of these
 applications, the mobility infrastructure is a shared resource in which all the players must cooperate. In fact, the driving task has been described as a “tango” where we—
as humans—cooperate to enable a robust transportation system. Can autonomous systems participate in this tango? Does that even make sense?
 This report will examine the current interaction points between humans and autonomous systems, the shortcomings of the current state of these systems with a
 particular focus on advanced driver assistance systems, the requirements for human machine interfaces as imposed by human perception, and finally, the progress being
 made to close the gap.},
