  abstract  = {This paper presents the submission by the HeiMorph team to the SIGMORPHON 2022 task 2 of Morphological Acquisition Trajectories. Across all experimental conditions, we have found no evidence for the so-called Ushaped development trajectory. Our submitted systems achieve an average test accuracies of 55.5{\%} on Arabic, 67{\%} on German and 73.38{\%} on English. We found that, bigram hallucination provides better inferences only for English and Arabic and only when the number of hallucinations remains low.},
